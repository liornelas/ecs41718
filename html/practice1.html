            Rosa Parks was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement who refused to give up her seat on a bus to make room for white passengers when she was instructed to, and was then arrested.<br><u>She then started a bus boycott to fight and change the rules in order to have  equal rights on the buses and other public facilities.</u><br> Because of her arrest, and 381 days of the boycott, the buses were desegregated.
